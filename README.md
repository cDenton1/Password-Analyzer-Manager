# Password Analyzer & Manager <br>
Final project for ITSC-203 <br> <br>

Included in this directory are three main python files, one for the analyzer section of the program, one for the manager section, and one for the GUI code. The rest of the text files are used by the analyzing file to check and compare with the users input. <br> <br> 

The purpose of the program is to offer actual feedback to a users password and a strength score that properly aligns with what makes a strong password. In todays reality websites don't properly check for strong passwords, they check for very minimal things, and there are even chances where they include a strength meter but they don't mean anything when you actually look at what they consider strong. Along with analyzing the users input, there is also the choice to store the password in the manager, which is password protected. So while you check to make sure your password is actually strong, you can also store them all in one place, locally on your device, behind a password so you never have to worry about forgetting them or having them leaked in a data breach. <br> <br>

Note: rockyou.txt is not in this repository due to it's size, the program runs just fine without it but it is one of the ten criteria checks and is recommended
