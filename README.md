# Password Analyzer & Manager
Final project for my ITSC-203 class, Scripting for Tool Construction

## About
This is a password analyzer that offers actual feedback to a users password and a strength score that properly aligns with what makes a strong password, alongside a local, password protected, password manager. 

Most websites today check for very few details and sometimes also include a strength meter that focuses on components they deem strong, but actually aren't. When you check to make sure your password is actually strong, you can also store them all in one place, locally on your device, behind a password so you never have to worry about forgetting them or having them leaked in a data breach. <br>

## Use
* Included in this repository are three main python files, **analyzeCode.py**, **manageCode.py**, and **guiCode.py**.
* The rest of the text files are used by the analyzing file to check and compare with the users input.
* All necessary files need to be in the same directory, and guiCode.py is the main file to run when using it.

### Note:
rockyou.txt is not in this repository due to it's size, the program runs without it but it is highly recommended.
